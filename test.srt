To

14
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,320
do

15
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,770
this,

16
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:07,900
press

17
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,500
control

18
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:08,860
alt

19
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:08,960
T

20
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,190
to

21
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,890
launch

22
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,000
a

23
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,430
terminal.

24
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,920
Type

25
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,770
.space

26
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,790

27
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,070

28
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,150

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,540
enter.

30
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,640
This

31
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,700
is

32
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:15,780
a

33
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,090
test

34
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,300
to

35
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:16,500
see

36
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:16,680
how

37
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:16,860
well

38
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,160

captioning

40
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,030

00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,820
Hopefully

42
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:19,950
it

43
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,340
won't

44
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,500
be

45
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,160
terribly

46
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,710
bad.

47
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:21,760
Do

48
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:21,860
you

49
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,060
see

50
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,260
any

51
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,880
issues?
